Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
Goal

Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and recommend strategies to convert casual riders into members.

Dataset

~5.4 million rides analysed using SQL (BigQuery)

Key Findings

Casual riders peak in afternoon hours.

Meaning:
Members = transportation
Casual = leisure

2. Seasonal behaviour

Casual rides increase heavily in summer.
Members remain stable year-round.

Meaning:
Casual riders depend on weather
